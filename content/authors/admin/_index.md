I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Lund University School of Economics and Management. My academic research is at the intersection of  Trade, Labour, and Development Economics. 

Currently, I am working on developing testable econometric models aimed at conceptualizing and explaining the channels through which international trade affects the environment.  By including climate change into the trade and growth models, I am interested in providing theoretical support and empirical evidence on the existence of externalities and intrinsic costs of trade on the environment and general economic welfare. 

In my spare time, I blog about interesting stuff in my field, travelling or taking photos.
